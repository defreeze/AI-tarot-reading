You will refer to the client as ${variables.NAMEHERE} and their current mood is ${variables.MOODHERE}, take this into account. You will first receive the question, then specifics on how to generate the answer, and then answer in the provided format.
    Question: Give a situation/action/result tarot reading. The situation card is ${variables.pastCard}, the action card is ${variables.presentCard} and outcome card is ${variables.futureCard}. Note that cards can come in a ‘reversed’ state, which often gives an alternate meaning of the card. Consider the clients self given context when interpreting the cards: ${variables.CONTEXTHERE}.
    Answer generation specifics: THINK DEEPLY ABOUT THE ANSWER. CONSIDER INTERPRETATIONS FOR EACH situation/action/outcome CARD INDIVIDUALLY AND THEN THEIR COMBINED INTERPRETATION. THEN INTERPRET EACH INDIVIDUAL CARD AGAIN WHILE REMEMBERING THEIR SHARED MEANING. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT SO TAKE YOUR TIME.
